📝 DESCRIPTION
------------------------------
This workflow creates an end-to-end Instagram content pipeline that automatically discovers trending content from competitor channels, extracts valuable insights, and generates new high-quality scripts for your own content creation. The system helped scale an Instagram channel from 0 to 10,000 followers in just 15 days through intelligent content repurposing.

Benefits:

Complete Content Automation - Monitors competitor Instagram accounts, downloads new reels, and processes them without manual intervention
AI-Powered Script Generation - Uses ChatGPT and Perplexity to analyze content, identify tools/technologies, and rewrite scripts with fresh angles
Smart Duplicate Prevention - Automatically tracks processed content in a database to avoid redundant work
Multi-Platform Intelligence - Combines Instagram scraping, AI transcription, web research, and content generation in one seamless flow
Scalable Content Strategy - Process content from multiple niches and creators to fuel unlimited content ideas
Revenue-Focused Approach - Specifically designed to identify monetizable tools and technologies for business-focused content

How It Works:

Instagram Content Discovery:
Uses Apify's Instagram scraper to monitor specified creator accounts for new reels
Automatically downloads video content and metadata from target accounts
Filters content based on engagement metrics and relevance

Intelligent Processing Pipeline:

Transcribes video content using OpenAI Whisper for accurate text extraction
Filters content using AI to identify tools, technologies, and automation opportunities
Cross-references against existing database to prevent duplicate processing

Enhanced Research & Analysis:

Searches Perplexity AI for additional insights about discovered tools
Generates step-by-step usage guides and implementation instructions
Identifies unique angles and opportunities for content improvement

Script Generation & Optimization:

Creates new, original scripts optimized for your specific audience
Maintains consistent brand voice while adding fresh perspectives
Includes strategic call-to-action elements for audience engagement

Required Google Sheets Database Setup:
Before running this workflow, create a Google Sheets database with these exact column headers:
Essential Columns:

id - Unique Instagram post identifier (primary key for duplicate detection)
timestamp - When the reel was posted
caption - Original reel caption text
hashtags - Hashtags used in the post
videoUrl - Direct link to download the video file
username - Account that posted the reel
scrapedTranscript - Original transcript from video (added by workflow)
newTranscript - AI-generated script for your content (added by workflow)

Additional Tracking Columns:

shortCode - Instagram's internal post code
url - Public Instagram post URL
commentsCount - Number of comments
firstComment - Top comment on the post
likesCount - Number of likes
videoViewCount - View count metrics
videoDuration - Length of video in seconds

Setup Instructions:

Create a new Google Sheet with these column headers in the first row
Name the sheet "Reels"
Connect your Google Sheets OAuth credentials in n8n
Update the document ID in the workflow nodes

The merge logic relies on the id column to prevent duplicate processing, so this structure is essential for the workflow to function correctly.


Business Use Cases:

Content Creators - Scale content production by 10x while maintaining quality and originality
Marketing Agencies - Offer content research and ideation as a premium service
Course Creators - Identify trending tools and technologies for educational content

Revenue Potential:

This exact system can be sold as a service for $3,000-$5,000 to growing channels or agencies. The automation saves 10+ hours weekly of manual research and content planning.

Difficulty Level: Intermediate
Estimated Build Time: 1-2 hours
Monthly Operating Cost: ~$30 (API usage)
